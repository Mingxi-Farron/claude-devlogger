## Devlog

Session tracking via `devlog/` folder. Time tracked in `devlog/TIME.md`.

**Commands:**
- `/devlog-start` - Begin session, set goals & plan
- `/devlog-end` - End session, record problems/solutions, update time
- `/devlog-status` - Show session info & total time
- `/devlog-final` - Generate final project assessment

**Screenshots:** Say "screenshot: [description]" to log a screenshot with timestamp.

Natural language works too: "start logging", "end session", "how much time?", "finalize project"
