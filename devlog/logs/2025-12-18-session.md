# Session #3
**Date:** 2025-12-18 | **Start:** Now

## Goals
- [ ] Explore options for the waterfall

## Plan
- Research and evaluate different approaches for waterfall implementation

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem:** Niagara very laggy with fluid simulation
  - **Solution:** Close preview in Niagara, and turn off auto-activate
- **Problem:** Confusion between water height, local space, and world space
  - Local space cannot be toggled at runtime

## Notes
- Isolate properties: SpawnRate
- Create section and category for Niagara parameters
- Isolate spawner position offset
  - **Caution:** Ensure using the same coordinate system throughout
  - Using simulation (local) coordinates, not world coordinates
- Add AutoActivate to favorites for quick access in editor
